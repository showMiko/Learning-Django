Django has one Project and Multiple Apps. 

in the views files we add the functions of the routes. Bacisally the controllers. 
WE add routes in the manage.py files.


After Creating the app -->
1. First Step is to make sure the project knows app is made.
2. in settings.py we need to make sure, the app is present. we nee to add it.
3. After we are done now we can go into the new app and create templates folder.
4. we dont need to add this file again to the settings since it's alreay done.
5. we may choose to create subfolders under this.
6. app doesnot have urls.py. So we will create One.
7. The main Urls.py file need to know that there are sub url files in each app.
8. The control needs to pass from the main urls.py to app urls.py
9. In main urls.py we will import 'include'
10. we nned to add a new route like this path('basics/', include('basics.urls'))
11. This Transfers the controls to the APP.
