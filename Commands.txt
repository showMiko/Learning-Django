django-admin startproject -- Used at first
python manage.py startapp <appname>  -- Used for creaing Apps
python manage.py runserver 8001 -- The Port no is optional
manage.py is the starting point
db.sqlite3 is the default DB.
settings.py is the config files
urls.py is the routes files --> This handles the routing. 

uv pip install django-tailwind
uv pip install 'django-tailwind[reload]'
python -m ensurepip --upgrade (if pip is not present)


Django has one Project and Multiple Apps. 

in the views files we add the functions of the routes. Bacisally the controllers. 
WE add routes in the manage.py files.


After Creating the app -->
1. First Step is to make sure the project knows app is made.
2. in settings.py we need to make sure, the app is present. we nee to add it.
3. After we are done now we can go into the new app and create templates folder.
4. we dont need to add this file again to the settings since it's alreay done.
5. we may choose to create subfolders under this.
6. app doesnot have urls.py. So we will create One.
7. The main Urls.py file need to know that there are sub url files in each app.
8. The control needs to pass from the main urls.py to app urls.py
9. In main urls.py we will import 'include'
10. we nned to add a new route like this path('basics/', include('basics.urls'))
11. This Transfers the controls to the APP.



Layouts-->
1. Basically a Common File Where we can use the content with variables
2. Dynamic rendering at different pages
3. for eg Navbar, we can make it here, and then we can get navbar at all places.


Tailwind Setup -->
1. Add a new app to the settings.py (tailwind)
2. python manage.py tailwind init
3. Add a new app to the settings.py (theme)
4. In settings.py --> TAILWIND_APP_NAME = 'theme' 
                      INTERNAL_IPS = ['127.0.0.1']
5.Install Tailwind python manage.py tailwind install
6. If the above fails we need to point Django to our location of the installed Node. 
7. In setting.py paste --> NPM_BIN_PATH = r"C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd"
8. If node is present in a different path we can find it by using the 'where.exe npm' command 
9. In a seperate terminal we need to start tailwind.
10. python manage.py tailwind start
